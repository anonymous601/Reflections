Reflect 1 : How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

			Running the diff command can track minor errors which I tend to overlook while debugging manuaaly like searching for a ';'. It also helps me compare any two versions and not only the current and most recently updated one. 
			
Reflect 2 : How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you more efficient programmer in the long run?

			It helps me track my improvement, and how the project started, and how it has evolved. Also, I can revert back if an unwanted bug is introduced. It also saves time, efforts and frustration while debugging.
			
Reflect 3 : What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

            Pros- We can decide whenever we want to save. Cons- User may forget to save or might save a lot.
			
Reflect 4 : Why do you think some versions controls, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others like, Google Docs, treat each file separately?

			Because for coding projects, we may have multiple files, like one defining functions, one for classes etc.
			
Reflect 5 : How can you use commands like git log and git diff to view history of files?

			Git log can be used all prewvious commits, while git diff can be used to compare code between two commits.
			
Reflect 6 : How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

			Using version control allows me to make major changes without fear, as I can revert back to original state whenever I want.
			
Reflect 7 : Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
  
			As I'm starting on a project, and also to discover more cool projects online.
